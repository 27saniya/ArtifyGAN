# ArtifyGAN - Animated Face Image Generation using GANs

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop an efficient and realistic animated facial image generation system using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), addressing the inefficiencies prevalent in current technologies. The project aims to leverage GAN architecture to generate high-quality animations from single or limited reference images, capturing fine details that current systems often miss. Training the model on a comprehensive dataset will enable it to accurately represent a wide array of facial styles, thereby improving the realism and versatility of the resulting animations.
